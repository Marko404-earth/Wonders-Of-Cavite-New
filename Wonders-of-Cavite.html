      <h3>Cavite is a historic, populous, and rapidly industrializing province in the CALABARZON region of the Philippines. It is known as the "Historical Capital of the Philippines" for its crucial role in the country's fight for independence from Spain.</h3>
      <br>
      <h3><strong>Geography:</strong> Located on the southern shores of Manila Bay, Cavite is bordered by Metro Manila to the northeast, Laguna to the east, and Batangas to the south.</h3>

      <h3><strong>Capital:</strong> The provincial capital is Imus, while the seat of the provincial government is in Trece Martires. The province is composed of 8 cities and 15 municipalities. While Tagalog is the most widely spoken language, a Spanish-based creole called Chavacano is also spoken in some areas, particularly Cavite City and Ternate.</h3>
