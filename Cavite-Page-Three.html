              <h3>Pipian</h3>
              <p>Pipian is a chicken stew from Cavite that is similar to kare-kare,
              but uses chicken and ground toasted rice or peanuts instead of
              oxtail and tripe. Its distinct flavor comes from the addition of
              kamias (bilimbi fruit) and epazote leaves, a herb of Mexican origin that arrived via the galleon trade.</p>

              <h3>Lumpia Fresca</h3>
              <p>Lumpia Fresca, also known as Lumpiang Sariwa, is a beloved fresh spring roll in Cavite,
               featuring vegetables like carrots, cabbage, and singkamas (jicama) wrapped in a soft crepe-like shell
               and served with a sweet, savory sauce.</p>

              <h3>Tamales</h3>
              <p>Tamales are a popular and traditional Filipino delicacy in Cavite City and the province of Cavite,
               particularly during Christmas. The dish is made from a mixture of ground peanuts, rice flour (galapong), pork,
               chicken, hard-boiled eggs, and garbanzos, all steamed and wrapped in banana leaves.</p>

              <h3>Kilawin</h3>
              <p>In Cavite, kilawin is a unique dish that deviates from the raw-fish-based kinilaw found in other regions. 
              Instead, the Caviteño version is a cooked dish made from grated green papaya, vinegar, 
              and minced cow parts such as lungs and tripe (mindonggo).</p>

              <h3>Bacalao</h3>
              <p>Bacalao is a traditional dish from Cavite City, Philippines, inspired by Spanish cuisine. 
              While the Spanish version typically features salted codfish, the Caviteño version often uses dried surgeonfish 
              (labahita) due to the high cost of imported cod. It is a cherished heirloom recipe often prepared during Lent and Holy Week,
               when the faithful practice abstinence from meat.</p>
